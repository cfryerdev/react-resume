  "about": "An excited and passionate architect with experience building and leading teams to fruitful outcomes and successful deliveries. With almost 20 years of full-stack experience developing in the .net core ecosystem, I also have an extensive experience in node, java and a handful of others. My passion lies in the frontend primarily with React and Angular. I have an extensive background in managing and implementing various Agile processes.",
  "motto": "The code I write, the products I build, and the solutions I design, will one day be deprecated and will eventually disappear; but the people I build will go on to build others... and thats what lives on. That is what's most important."
